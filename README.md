#Allele Inheritance Simulator

This is a small project that simulates basic allele inheritance. The program creates a recursive family tree of generations and randomizes the terminal generation's blood type (the blood type of the oldest grandparents to be included.)

The program recursively prints the generation number and blood type for each generation.

Finally, the program recursively frees heap memory to prevent any memory leaks.
